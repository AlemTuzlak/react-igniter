Welcome to **react-igniter**!
<img src="./react-igniter.png" align="right" height="120px">

Command Line Interface built for generating common React code.

## What does it do?

React-igniter is a lightweight command line interface designed to help you in your everyday work. It offers you a quick way to generate a lot of boilerplate code like forms, routers, api files, and react components.

## What is new?

Release **v1.1.4** is out! New features include the following:

1. Added rootDir option for each generator
2. Added option to disable generators using configuration

The form generation feature is finally introduced in version 1.1.0 of react-igniter! Now you are able to create forms with [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) with per field configurations for field type and field validation. The **v1.1.X** versions of react-igniter will be focused on new form generation features. Roadmap will be updated accordingly!

## What does it generate?

It can generate either `typescript` or `javascript` versions of the following:

- React components
- React routers (via [React-router](https://reactrouter.com/))
- React Api files (via [Axios](https://axios-http.com/))
- React forms (via [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/))

All of the above features are configurable in what exactly you want to generate by choosing the different options in the actual CLI.

### **React components**

React components generator support the following features:

- Naming the component (reflected across all generated files)
- Adding test files with the first test already set up.
- Adding styling modules to the component (supports sass, css & styled-components)
- Choosing between typescript & javascript components.
- Adding storybook with the first story already set up.
- Choosing between default and named component export
- Choosing if you want to include the useTranslations hook from i18n
- Choosing if you want to include index file that exports the component or not

The generated output will be a folder containing the above mentioned features, the folder content will differ depending on the options you choose.

### **React routers**

React routers generator supports the following features:

- Naming the router
- Choosing if you want to generate tabs for the routes
- Creating an arbitrary amount of routes depending on your input (space separated values)
- Choosing if you are setting up the main application router or a sub-router
- Choosing between the typescript and javascript versions

The generator will require you to have `react-router` and `react-router-dom` packages installed in your project directory. It will automatically detect if you are using version 5 or 6 of the package and generate the appropriate files based on version.

### **React api**

React api generator supports the following features:

- Initializing the BaseApi class which handles the base configuration of the api like interceptors for requests and responses, headers and so on.
- Extended API's which inherit the BaseApi class and extend its configuration
- Choosing between typescript and javascript versions
- Adding CRUD operations to each generated API (excluding the base one)
- Adding the base prefix, defaults to `/`

This generator requires you to have `axios` installed in your project directory. The extended api's you create require the BaseApi import to work, once you generate the BaseApi you can add new files without re-initializing the base api.
The output will be generated to the `/api` folder.

### **React forms**

React forms generator supports the following features:

- Selection between typescript/javascript versions
- Naming the form component
- Choosing if you want to wrap the form with a context provider
- Output directory of the form
- Adding a list of fields that the form will have
- Choosing if the form should have validation or not
- Choosing validation mode and revalidation mode
- Choosing export type
- Choosing to include the index file or not
- Editing default configuration

After all these have been selected each field offers the following features:

- Selecting the type of component (input, textarea, checkbox, radio, select)
- If the input component is selected you can choose the subtype (email, password, url, date, datetime, text...)
- If form is validated you can choose validation rules (required, min, max, regex, custom, minLength, maxLength)

After all the options have been chosen the form will be generated.

### **React igniter configs**

Running the config setup will generate a config file in your current project directory with default presets which allows you to skip questions in the CLI, like choosing if you want to generate js/ts each time. Each time a new release is out the config file will be updated accordingly and you can just update it with the command already there.

To ignore your default configuration settings run any of the generators with the
`-i` flag and it will ignore the config file and ask you all the questions.

### **CLI Options**

- `rig -u` - Adding this flag tells the CLI to check if there is a newer version of the package and if there is, asks you if you want to upgrade.
- `rig component [name]` - Shortcut for getting into the component creation command, optional name parameter, if provided the name will be set to the provided parameter
- `rig router` - Shortcut for getting into the router creation command
- `rig api` - Shortcut for getting into the api creation command
- `rig config` - Shortcut for getting into the config creation command
- `rig form [name]` - Shortcut for getting into form creation command, optional name parameter, if provided the name will be set to the provided parameter

## How to get it up and running?

The whole installation is very simple. To use it you will need to have node installed and you can pull it in with the following command:

`npm install -g react-igniter`

After installation you can run `rig` to get the CLI which will guide you through the process of creating the component you need.

If you want to directly use it without actually installing it locally you can simply run:

`npx rig`

After this we recommend first choosing the option to initialize the configuration file and to set your values to whatever you wish for easier generation and a more pleasant experience.

If you want to check if there are updates to the package and install them you can run the following command:

`rig -u`

## Our vision

Our vision with this package is to speed up the every day development process and empower developers. We want to create a robust and extensive CLI to support as many cases as possible and to offer a lot of features out of the box.

## Feature roadmap

- Adding new configuration options for form generator to speed up the generation process âœ”
- Adding `form` shortcut for easier access
- Adding Control component option to form generator
- Adding yup validation as an option
- Adding inputArray option with **useFieldArray** hook
- Streamlining the generation process and improving the UX
- Adding some behind the scenes features to improve the generator (default validators for subtypes etc.)

## Developer note

If you like this package and find it useful please do consider giving the project a star on github. If you wish to see some features added feel free to contact the project contributors or submit a feature request on github.

Thank you for your support.

Happy coding!
